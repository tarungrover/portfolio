# **PART 3**

## Intended Audience

After careful consideration of the ffedback that I received after completing Part II and showing my wireframes and sketches to different users, I realized that I need to make
my target audience more general since the topic that I am choosing would eventually help everyone whenever they plan to buy a home in the United States. To be more precise,
this story is for anybody who ever so intends to but a house in US and wants to understand trends of the real estate market.

The major trend here is the seasonality and that is where the most of the emphasis is on since people already have a budget and the house size in their mind. So, a factor that
I highlight for the audience is the seasonality that hopefully people would remember while making a decision.

## Changes Made

Keeping the intended audience in mind, the below changes were added to the previous shorthand story:

* The flow of the story was incorporated to not just point out the trends in the seaosnality of real estate but also to point out some obvious facts in order for people to relate
to it and be able to set the context initially. This would make it easier for people to relate to and understand.
* The visualization were updated with appropriate headings and labesl on the plots created. The headings were made more self-explanantory keepin a general level of audience in
mind.
* Some of the visuals now represent aggregated information. Initially they did provide more flexibilty to user to choose the city they wanted to look at but then I realized that 
it is hard to scroll through so many cities and the information can be represented by aggregating it more amongs the states.
* The flow of the story has been updated to set the context intially and the flow makes more sense now.
* Some of the key elments in the visualization have been differentiated to point out the stark difference. Moreover, at some places Pitssburgh has been highlighted and been 
considered as one of the examples which would make it much more relatable to the audeince.

## Design Decisions

First of all lets talk about the flow that has been implemented by using apt design. The flow starts with different size of houses and how it affects the cost then moving forward 
we see the effect of location and other factors that affect the prices of house and at last we cover seasonality effects.

Now, All of this is highlighted by using appropriate design like creating a different sections of all titles that highlight the distinction but what we are currently talking about.
For example, the first section has a bolded title of Size effect then location and then seaosnality to capture the attention of audience.
