## Trends in Real Estate Data

For this project, I will be trying to demonstrate different visuaizations to provide better understanding of data and I will be trying to show the seasonality in real estate 
data trends pointing out renting and buying cost associated, the volume of houses availabel throughout different seasons and different months across years. One thing that I 
hope to accomplish using these visualizations is to explore and keep in mind such trends while making a decision regaridng renting and buying a real estate property for 
oneself.

Layout of the main visualizations in the project would include:

#### Home Values Visualization: 
A smoothed, seasonally adjusted measure of the typical home value and market changes across a given region and housing type. It reflects the typical value for homes in the 35th to 65th percentile range.

#### Home Values Forecasts: 
The Zillow Home Value Forecast (ZHVF) is the one-year forecast of the Zillow Home Values Index (ZHVI), which is above. ZHVF is created using the all homes, mid-tier cut of ZHVI and is available both 
raw and smoothed and seasonally adjusted.

#### Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI): 
This trend was also represented in my previous assignments and would be dwelling much more deeper into this trend.

#### Inventory and Listing Pricing:
Aother vizualization for pointing out trends through different times across different years.

And then maybe if I observe trends in Price cuts dataset , I will also try to visualize the price cuts taken during each month i.e. how much the cost of home changes through 
different months.

#### Further Steps

I will be trying to try and explore different visualizations on the dataset provided and getting feedbacks from people and then finalizing the type of viz that expresses the 
final message better, easy to understand and engages the audience. Before starting viz part, data cleansing manipulation will be performed using Python. Then, I will be 
trying Flourish and Tableau to play with different visualizations.

As for the final deliverable, the plan for now is to create a website using Shorthand and embedding these visualizations to form a story out of it keeping in mind that a 
person would use this a way to make a dicsion while renting/buying an apartment
