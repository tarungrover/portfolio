# Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI)

This index is a smoothed measure of the typical observed market rate rent across a given region. ZORI is a repeat-rent index that is weighted to the rental housing 
stock to ensure representativeness across the entire market, not just those homes currently listed for-rent. The index is dollar-denominated by computing 
the mean of listed rents that fall into the 40th to 60th percentile range for all homes and apartments in a given region, which is once again weighted 
to reflect the rental housing stock.

The reason behing choosing the zillow data set is to better visualize the rental data for past few years across different months in order to better figure out the 
rental price and the way it varies during a year. One can base their decisions of when to actually rent and the tenure of the lease to sign in order to save on rent.
The reason that I choose this viz is since I did struggle for 2-3 months to find a home within my budget and decide on the tenure of the rental lease I signed. Having
access to the data and visualization would turn out to be useful while going through the appartment hunt!

### Step 1 

Below is a vizualization from ZORI (zillow observed rental index) data set which represents the increase in total rent in major metro cities within the United States.
The viz is trying to represent the trend in some of the major cities from the year 2005 to 2019. One thing that the vizualization prominently represents is the increase
in rent through each year.

Some key Insights: All-in-all, U.S. renters paid roughly $4.5 trillion in rent during the 2010s, capped off with $512 billion in 2019 alone.

The total amount of money spent on rent nationwide over the past 10 years is higher than the GDP of Germany (a shade less than $4 trillion in 2018), the world’s fourth-largest 
national economy. Total rent paid in 2019 alone is higher than the entire 2018 GDP of Thailand ($505 billion) and just short of Argentina’s ($518 billion).
