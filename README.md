# About me

Name: Tarun Grover

I love working at intersection of people and technology. In my 3+ years of experience in Management Consulting, I have worked on various technologies to provide data driven solutions to clients and been recognized with multiple accolades for my contribution.

My experiences so far have made me realize that a specialization and better understanding of data and information systems management would be a great way to grow in the field. Hence, I am pursuing Master’s in Information Systems Management from Heinz College CMU.

I strongly believe that solution to an organization’s problem can be addressed by effective use of their data and my interest lies in roles where I can continuously learn and apply my skills to provide data driven solutions.

I am a big fan of Premier League, F1 and like playing Chess, Badminton and exploring new places.

# What I hope to learn

In simple words, I hope to learn and be profecient with expressing stories throguh data since data visualization is of paramount importnace in order to work with data.

# Portfolio

This will be where I would list about the cool stuff that I would be working within this course including project.

## Assigment 1

## Assignment 2

####General Government Debt

General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. Changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits.

Data:
Location: Countries with 3 word acronyms
Year: 1995-2019
Value: ratio of gross debt of general government as percentage of GDP.

#######VIZ 1

The below visualization represents the value on y-axis across different locations from the year 2020. The best part of the viusal is that one can seelct the respective location 
and that would change the color so forth. Moreover hovering over the bar shows a the value for that particular location.

#######VIZ 2

Below is a grid of line charts which is akin to Sparklines

#######VIZ 3

I tried multiple visualizations to represent government debt. One thing I wanted to add to the visualizations was the flexibility for the user to be selective with the locations
that they were interested in. Having multiple locations on viz makes it cumbersome to analyze any sort of thing. Below viz does a better job at addressing that. These graphs help enhance the comparisons among different locations which the previous visualizations were not able to produce at a glance.

The first one is a line chart which represents the ratio in a time series from 1995 to 2020. There is an option to select the countries that ones want to visualize 
from the graph. The maximum cap is 8 countries/locations, one would not be able to take more than 8 locations at once.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/7692294"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>


The maximum cao for the below area chart is 4 i.e. at max 4 countries can be visualized together on the viz to make it less cumbersome.

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/7696527"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>


The above 2 methods of visualization are different in their own ways. The line graph represents the increase and decrease whereas area chart do point our towards the intensity
of the ratio of debt to GDPs since this would provide better results if looked from the prespective of risk. The area chart is in proprotion to other countries selected hence it 
delas better with comparison.

Although the first 2 were able to visualize the data for 1 year and different years respectively, they did make comparisons cumbersome to be performed as a time series. Since
time series are a good viz for analysis and comparisons, in order to incorporate all years and get a meaning at a single glance I used the above 2 visualizations.
