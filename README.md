# About me

Name: Tarun Grover

I love working at intersection of people and technology. In my 3+ years of experience in Management Consulting, I have worked on various technologies to provide data driven solutions to clients and been recognized with multiple accolades for my contribution.

My experiences so far have made me realize that a specialization and better understanding of data and information systems management would be a great way to grow in the field. Hence, I am pursuing Master’s in Information Systems Management from Heinz College CMU.

I strongly believe that solution to an organization’s problem can be addressed by effective use of their data and my interest lies in roles where I can continuously learn and apply my skills to provide data driven solutions.

I am a big fan of Premier League, F1 and like playing Chess, Badminton and exploring new places.
