## User Research Protocol

Above is a rough draft of the Shorthand page that I Will be developing as part of my final project. I will be conducting user research with 3 different individuals to 
understand their presepective about the page and visualizations created. Further changes will be made based on their feedback. I will be conducting my interviews with adults 
between the age of 22-40.

## Apprach to identify target audeince

The essential target audience would be people who are looking to change their places or looking to buy a house. As for my research, I would be collecting it from 2 CMU 
graduate students to gain a better prespective on the visualizations and one from a middle aged working person who would provide me a feedback on whether the story would be 
any helpful in totality or not.

## Interview Script

My name is Tarun Grover, currently a graduate student at CMU. As part of my final project for Telling Stories with Data course, I am conducting research on Real Estate trends 
across months the seasonality of these trends. I have prepared a webpage and some visualization with it, I would like to ask you a series of questions as part of the survey which would take around 5 minutes. Please take your time to go 
through the website and answer the questions below:

1. What do you think is the central idea of the webpage?
2. Do you unerstand the flow of ideas on this page?
3. Can you please explain what you understood from viz 1? Is there any bit that was confusing to you or something that you would like to do differently.
4. Can you please explain what you understood from viz 2? Is there any bit that was confusing to you or something that you would like to do differently.
5. Can you please explain what you understood from viz 3 and 4? Is there any bit that was confusing to you or something that you would like to do differently.
6. Any last feedbacks regarding the color scheme or background of the entire page?

## Interview

##### What do you think is the central idea of the webpage?
All the people got the idea that the page is related to Real Estate trends and all associated the page with saving cost on buying a home within the United States. All 
mentioned that page stated the topic initially and that helped them figure out the topic. All three also mentioned that after looking at the data and description, the 
data has been taken up from Zillow.

#### Do you unerstand the flow of ideas on this page?
Person B mentioned that there was a sort of disconnect within the flow of the page and the transition could be made better. Person A and B felt moderate about the flow and 
were able to comprehend it. 

#### Can you please explain what you understood from viz 1? Is there any bit that was confusing to you or something that you would like to do differently.
Person A and B mentioned about the title of the viz being below the viz, they immediately got the intention of pointing out the average price across different months and 
different regions. However, the title being mentioned below the viz was an issue here for them.

Person C pointed out that had the bars been sorted wither in the form of value in value or the size of home, it would have been easier to read. Also, highlighting the one 
with the highest value would be a good way of representation.

#### Can you please explain what you understood from viz 2? Is there any bit that was confusing to you or something that you would like to do differently.
All 3 people were not able to understand the viz and were not able to comprehend what is it trying to convey. The bubles were not visible and then they were not able to 
understand the hierarchy of the bubles.

Once they selected particular filter, they were able to understand what the bubles were presenting initially in default selection of "All".

#### Can you please explain what you understood from viz 3 and 4? Is there any bit that was confusing to you or something that you would like to do differently.
Person C was happy with the viz and and got the message and was able to notice the interesting insights. 

Person A and B had similar feedback but pointed out that an area line chart or the color beneath the line was not really required.

#### Any last feedbacks regarding the color scheme or background of the entire page?
All three concluded saying that they got the message but this page could eventually have a much better presentation and would help people way much.

## Changes to be implemented

After receiving the feedback, I have decided on the below changes to be made further.

1. Since everyone understood the idea of the page, I would essentially extend these and generate more viz using the dataset I have.
2. Changes to be made to viz 2. Would have to re-consider the buble chart or imprve it.
